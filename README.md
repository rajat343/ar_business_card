## Introduction

Traditional business cards are limited by size, lack of interactivity, and accessibility 
challenges, especially for people with vision impairments. This project aims to modernize 
the business card experience by integrating AR technology. By scanning a business card with 
a mobile device, users can access extended information and explore interactive 3D content, 
creating a richer and more accessible experience.

The application uses Unity and Vuforia for image recognition and AR rendering, enabling 
users to view additional business information and interact with virtual objects associated 
with the card.


## Features

- **Enhanced Information Access**: Unlock additional information beyond the static text 
  on a business card.
- **Virtual 3D Map**: View location-based information and maps through AR directly on the 
  business card.
- **Industry-Specific Functionalities**:
  - Builders can showcase virtual tours of buildings or construction sites.
  - Showroom owners can provide interactive 3D views of products, allowing customers to 
    explore options like color and features.
- **AR Marker Recognition**: Business cards serve as AR markers, enabling easy and accurate 
  information retrieval.
- **Unity and Vuforia Integration**: The application is built on Unity and uses the Vuforia 
  library for image recognition and AR tracking.


## Technology Stack

- **Unity**: Game engine used for creating and rendering the AR experience.
- **Vuforia**: AR platform for marker-based tracking and image recognition.
- **C#**: Primary programming language for scripting in Unity.
- **JavaScript**: Used for additional scripting.
- **Image Processing**: Processes business card images for AR marker recognition and 
  content augmentation.
